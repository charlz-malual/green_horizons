Some say it’s the Serengeti and the movement of the countless wildebeest there, others – most notably the South Sudanese themselves! – claim the honor for this vast swathe of wilderness that clings to the edge of the Ethiopian border in the east. But whether you come to see the great peregrinations of the white-eared kob or not, you can rest assured the park will be one to remember. Zebras and gazelles, oryx, cheetah and gliding vultures are all visible, hiding amidst the rolling savannah and occasional bluffs of rock.",

Animal wise, you’ll get all of the biodiversity of the larger park to the north, along with lions and hippos, wild foxes and swinging primates of different kinds, not to mention elephants by the hundred! Shambe Nature Reserve is also a designated birding area, made popular thanks to countless migratory species that pass this way throughout the year.",

Spread out over the riparian grass plains that stretch eastwards from the White Nile River, it’s a surprisingly accessible place – thanks largely to that proximity to the capital at Juba; and surprising because stats show that still hardly anyone comes here! If you do decide to take the trip after the current Sudanese troubles reside, you can expect the likes of Nubian giraffes and elephants to pepper the vistas at Bandingilo!",
